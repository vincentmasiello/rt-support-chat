## rt-support-chat

This is a realtime support/chat app written as an excercise in react and go. There will be support for channels, users and messages. All three sections are relatively the same.

I'm working on this alongside a Udemy course by James Moore (@uknowthen). After coding the channels section the course challenges students to write the users & messages sections completely on their own.
