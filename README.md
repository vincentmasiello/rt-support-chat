# rt-support-chat
A real-time chat app written using React. The server side is in Go and can be found [here](https://github.com/vvmk/rt-support-chat-server).

I wrote the initial app alongside a course by [James Moore](https://github.com/knowthen)

### planned features: 
+ private messages
+ authentication

### issues
+ edit channel button just sends the channel (no way to actually edit), not sure if theres a need to edit channels at all but i left it there for now.
